I've been working on a timer device for F3K, since I dislike the Android application options, and relish clicky-buttons. As a bonus, use this hardware to experiment with your own Arduino-based project.

These are modeled after the Armsoar timers that are no longer for sale.
Simple operation:
- left button starts the round window timer.
- right button starts and stops the flight. Flight times added to "stack" on right side of screen.
- if >5 flights, left button cycles display through list.

Features:
- 1/10th second time log (for new rules)
- bar graph indicator of 1/10ths between seconds. Easier to judge time ticks than a blur of digits.
- 3xAAA batteries included (or replace with your own 1S lipo)
- easy-to-read LCD for outdoors
- battery voltage display at bootup
- add your own.. it's open-sourced software/hardware! Maybe add countdown timers vs count-up. Maybe vibration-feedback for launch/land or last 10 seconds. Two additional buttons are ready-to-mount for the DIYer.

The best feature is that this can serve as a development platform for many other projects; it combines a 3.3v Arduino clone, LCD screen, and buttons on a custom PCB.

Shipping ~$8 priority mail flat-rate box, or maybe a few dollars cheaper via 1st class.
